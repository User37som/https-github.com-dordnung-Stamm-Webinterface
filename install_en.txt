 2. MySQL
	Import the dbsql.sql with e.g. PHPMyAdmin into your MySQL database.
	
 3. Configuration
	3.1 Serverlist
		If you run stamm only on one server, than you only have to upload the contents of the "Server" folder.
		If you run stamm on more than one server, than you can create a overview of the servers.
		For every server you have to copy the "Server" folder and you have to rename it.
		Afterwards you have to open the "config.php" in the mainfolder and have to add the server there.
		For every server you can have a own pic in the "pics" folder.
	3.2 Webinterface
		Open the "config.php" in the server folder and set up everything.
		
 4. Pictures
	In the "pics" folder you find the .psd files of all header pictures.
	These you can modify for your community and save them as .jpg.
	You have to modify the "logo.jpg" also in the server folder under "inc/pics"!
	
 5. Upload
	Now load up everything to your webspace and you are ready to go!
	
 6. Changing Colors
	If you don't like the colors, you can modify the "style.css" in the mainfolder and in the server folder under "inc"!
